### Hi, I'm Konstantin.

I build complex infrastructure for businesses that can't afford to get it wrong. Payments, GDPR, data isolation, compliance — the stuff most developers avoid.

Former product leader at [N26](https://n26.com) and [Urban Sports Club](https://urbansportsclub.com). Now building [Kaufmann Health](https://kaufmann-health.de), a platform connecting clients with licensed psychotherapists in Germany.

Based in New York. More at [kkauf.com](https://kkauf.com).
