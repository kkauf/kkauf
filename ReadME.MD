### Hi, I'm Konstantin.

I build software for healthcare — currently [Kaufmann Health](https://kaufmann-health.de), a platform connecting clients with licensed psychotherapists in Germany.

Before that: payments infrastructure at N26, platform engineering and cloud migrations, B2B integrations. I like working on complex, security-sensitive systems where reliability matters.

Based in New York. More at [kkauf.com](https://kkauf.com).
